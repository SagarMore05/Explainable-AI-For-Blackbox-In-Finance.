# Explainable-AI-For-Blackbox-In-Finance.
## 📖 Overview
FinCoach AI is an Explainable AI-powered web application designed to make loan approval systems more transparent and customer-friendly. Traditional machine learning models often act as black boxes, giving loan applicants only a “Yes” or “No” without explaining the decision. This project solves that problem by combining loan approval prediction, explainable AI techniques, and financial guidance into one platform.

Using a trained machine learning model, the app predicts whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on factors like income, age, EMIs, and loan amount. It then applies SHAP and LIME explainability methods to show the key reasons behind the decision in simple terms, such as “High EMI compared to income” or “Low monthly income.”

Beyond loan prediction, FinCoach AI also acts as a financial coach. If a loan is rejected, it provides personalized savings tips, investment suggestions, and goal-based financial roadmaps to help users improve their eligibility in the future. The clean and interactive Streamlit dashboard makes it easy for both customers and bank officers to interpret results.

By integrating machine learning, explainable AI, and financial coaching, this project demonstrates how AI can improve decision-making, build customer trust, and support banks in offering fairer and more transparent financial services.
